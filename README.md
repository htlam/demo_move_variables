# Demo Move Variables

An **interactive demonstration** on how to *swap variables* and *manipulate array elements* for beginners.

A program statement does not really *move* variable. It *copies* and *overwrites* the value of variable. Therefore, a dummy variable is often used to hold the temporary value.

The following tasks are included to help students learn these maneuvers:

* Swap A and B
* Swap A[1] and A[3]
* Delete A[1]
* Insert X at A[1]
* Move A[3] before A[0]
* Reverse A

In addition, the code is intentionally written in a single Python file without OOP to show students how to build a GUI with Python using the [Tkinter package](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/). It would be much better to use OOP design or other UI frameworks to develop the demo.
